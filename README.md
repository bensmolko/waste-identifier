# waste-identifier

This machine learning project aims to simplify composting by distinguishing between artificial and organic waste to an exceptional degree. I began this project after my club -- the Environmental Awareness Club of Hudson High School -- collectively wanted to look into composting at our high school. One problem we envisioned with composting would be a general lack of knowledge about what kind of waste is best suited for a compost pile. To make this process a little bit easier, I used the knowledge I gained from the Stanford-Coursera machine learning course that I participated in to create this algorithm.

As is, you will not be able to pull this repository to your computer and use it. To effectively run this program, you would have to download the 22,500 training and testing images from the link I attached to the bottom of this file, change the file paths to match the location of these images, and then run the program.

I have plans to turn this into a mobile application so that everyone can take advantage of this algorithm without having to run the raw code. In the meantime, this is more of a proof-of-concept, and my most effective machine learning project to date.
